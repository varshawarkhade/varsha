<big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know selection of stay place at any picnic spot is a crucial part of picnic. 

The <font  color='black'><b>State's Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC)</b></font> has its resort here which offers affordable to luxury accommodations with the best facilities and an amazing view of the lake. There are a couple other resorts that offer decent lodgings in the area. The peak season sees a rush of pre-bookings and the prices are thus fixed. However, off seasons the prices are relaxed and accommodation is easily available.
