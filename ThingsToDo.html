In the monsoons, when the water level rises the gates of the dam opens itself to release water into the plains and you can go to the edge of the Garden to enjoy the sprinkles of the water. <br>There is another popular spot here known as the Umbrella Falls - which is seen in its prime in the monsoons.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mt. Kalsubai is the highest peak of the Sahyadri Ranges, from Bhandardara you can view this majestic mountain. <br>It is a popular trekking spot as are the hills nearby.<br>

The trek is a very tricky one and usually the experienced trekkers find their way to the top with some difficulty. <br>There are now man-made stairs to reach the peak if you don't wish to trek. However, the hills near the Kalsubai peak are relatively easier to scale.
